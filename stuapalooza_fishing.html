  <p>Good evening fellow fisherman.</p>

  <p>After we hawl in some sharks we will be heading back to my premises in Carlton North and either <strong>A</strong>) Cook the fish on the webber, drink more beer and tell lies, or <strong>B</strong>) Regroup, head to a local pub and tell lies.</p>

  <p>Below is a list of things you need to do or be aware of before hawling in a shark.</p>

  <h4>Make sure you do the following</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>The boat leaves at 11.30am from St Kilda pier and goes until 3.30pm. The name of our boat is the Bella Sandro, there will be a BBQ on board for lunch. Be there a bit before 11:30am or we might leave without you.</li>
    <li>Purchase a fishing license for the day. You can do so for $6 from <a href="http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/fishing-and-hunting/recreational-fishing/fishing-licence">Here</a></li>
    <li>The weather forcasted for Saturday is 22 degrees, with a 6% chance of rain. Wear a raincoat Billy!</li>
    <li>Make sure you bring $100 on the day if you haven't paid me already or I'll be out of pocket.</li>
    <li>You'll need to sort out your own alcohol and refer to the next point</li>
    <li>Take note of the following message regarding alcohol (interpret it as you please, we are a private charter):
      <blockquote>
        <strong>ALCOHOL MANAGEMENT - WE ARE A LICENSED PREMISES</strong><br/>
        'On a shared charter, having consideration to other passengers a couple of cans per person may be consumed. We are a little  more lenient with Private Charters as they have the boat to themselves, but all policies must be adhered to. It is permissive for a  small  amount of alcohol ( beer or premixed, still wine) to be brought aboard for personal consumption - a small amount is  considered no  more than 4 cans per person. It is always requested that any alcohol brought onto the boat be in cans.'<br/>
        <strong>NO HARD  SPIRIT POLICY APPLIES.</strong>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
